Based on the book:
  Building a Large language Model (From Scratch) - Sebastian Raschika

what is LLM?
Deep Neural Network (DNN) - trained on large amount of text data.
"large" - due to the size of paramaters. current billions to trillions
"language" NLP(used to be for specific task) - now handles range of tasks

Transformer Architecture    

[LLM] vs [GenAI] vs [Deep Learning(DL)] vs [Machine Learning]

---hierarchy---
AI -> ML -> DL -> LLM(Text only)

GenAI == LLM + DL

LLM applications
 - content genration
 - Sentiment Analysis
 - Chatbots/Virtual Assistants
 - Machine translation
 - (New)Novel text genration
